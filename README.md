python coding for AI

## step 1, perceptron
four gates are able to achieve all computations, for complex problems, multi-layered perceptron will solve most of them.
weight-w and bias-b are two key factors for AI algorithm, they have infinit solutions. Therefore, find the best w and b will be the next step to set up the algorithm.
