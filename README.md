python coding for AI

## step 1, perceptron
four gates are able to achieve all computations, for complex problems, multi-layered perceptron will solve most of them.
weight-w and bias-b are two key factors for AI algorithm, they have infinit solutions. Therefore, find the best w and b will be the next step to set up the algorithm.

## step 2, activationFunction
activation functions will allow machine to start with data and find the pattern. as the basic way, weight and bias will be given, so we can have a better idea about how activation function works. so with activation function, here we use sigmoid, we can see that data go through each layer and each neure. this is how neure network find pattern and give the result by pass through each layer x -> z1 ->z2 ... -> y.

## step 3, classification problem
